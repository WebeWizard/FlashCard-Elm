## FlashCard Game
The point of the FlashCard game is to build vocabulary tied to concepts instead of other words.

This is accomplished by practicing vocab flashcards in **three modes**.
#### Mode 1 - Study
- User sees native word or phrase and foreign translation with pictures demonstrating the concept.
- User can study each card as much as they want

#### Mode 2 - Practice
- User sees native word or phrase and pictures demonstrating the concept **but must enter the foreign translation**
- User can optionally see the translation if they get stuck.
- User **must complete three rounds** of Practice Mode before unlocking the Exam mode.

#### Mode 3 - Exam
- User only sees images that demonstrate the concept. They must type the foreign word or phrase that represents the concept.  (This should help disassociate the native word.)


## Topics
Topics can be standalone subjects or they can be nested.
- Each standalone subject will have the 3-mode flashcard game.
- If nested, parent subjects should have an additional 3-mode flashcard game using phrases that combine vocab learned in the child subjects but it can only be "unlocked" by completing all of the child subjects.
- Topics should NEVER only have 1 subtopic.


## Notes
Repeatedly studying a large stack of cards is scientifically more efficient than repeatedly studying the same cards split into smaller stacks.  So, perhaps aim for 1 stack of 20 or 30 instead of 2 or 3 stacks of 10.

## Advanced Features
Detect when users are no longer efficiently learning?  Maybe if they start a new subject and they make many mistakes.
